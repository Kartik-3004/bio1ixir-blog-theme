      <description>Bee found his honey! Ever wondered how honeybees are able to turn flower nectar into honey? Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice and informative post by Debble Hadley on https://www.thoughtco.com/ - &amp;ldquo;How Bees Turn Flower Nectar Into Honey &amp;ldquo;
The post briefly touches upon the organisational structure within a bee colony and how the distribution of labour is implemented within it. In pretty plain English, it has been described how forager bee goes distances around the hive, from flower to flower in order to collect nectar and thereafter, do inversion all the way through handing off the nectar to house bees and finally to the cell of honeycomb.</description>

      <description>Originally answered on Quora- How is B.Tech. in Bioengineering program at IIT Jodhpur with respect to faculty, internship, and student exchange programs? 
 B.Tech. in Bio engineering (formerly Biotechnology) at IITJ has seen its first undergraduate batch in 2018. As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, it makes the senior most batch of this branch in sophomore year. Many things are yet to happen to its first batch itself to which respect they can narrate the know-hows to the world.</description>

 Scientific methods That would be so awful if I start explaining to you the importance of Science and over-the-top deal of certainty in scientific methods.
