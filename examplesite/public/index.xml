      <description>Website Theme Bio1ixir Blog is a static website generated using hugo in a hope that it&amp;rsquo;ll make it easier for aspiring authors to post their creation without needing any knowledge of markup language and cascade styling. For this purpose, the theme which it uses is designed by Archit Dwivedi (designing counts- user interface, logo, colour schemes, fonts and template as a whole) and have been added as a submodule in the main blog repository.</description>

As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, it makes the senior most batch of this branch in sophomore year. Many things are yet to happen to its first batch itself to which respect they can narrate the know-hows to the world.</description>

 Scientific methods That would be so awful if I start explaining to you the importance of Science and over-the-top deal of certainty in scientific methods. So in laymen&amp;rsquo;s words, you observe, enquire, do background research, make hypothesis, undertake rigorous experiments, formulate and test your hypothesis, modify your hypothesis and make conclusions accordingly to have a rich and juicy theory.</description>
