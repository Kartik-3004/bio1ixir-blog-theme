# [Website Theme](https://github.com/bio1ixir/bio1ixir-blog-theme)

Bio1ixir Blog is a static website generated using hugo in a hope that it'll make it easier for aspiring authors to post their creation without needing any knowledge of markup language and cascade styling. For this purpose, the theme which it uses is designed by [Archit Dwivedi](https://github.com/evi1haxor) (*designing* counts- user interface, logo, colour schemes, fonts and template as a whole) and have been added as a submodule in the main blog repository.
