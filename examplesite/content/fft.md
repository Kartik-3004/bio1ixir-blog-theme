overview: "Hopes to retrieve the Vikram lander, with rover Pragyan housed inside it, are fading as the 14-day window for the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) to restore its link with the lander ended on Saturday (September 21). The lander and the rover have a mission life of 14 earth days. Lander Vikram, with rover Pragyan housed inside it, lost communication with ground-station on September 7 seven during its final descent, just 2.1 km above the lunar surface, minutes before the planned touch-down on the Moon."

# [Bee found his honey!](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-do-bees-make-honey-1968084)

Ever wondered how honeybees are able to turn flower nectar into honey? Here's a nice and informative post by Debble Hadley on https://www.thoughtco.com/ - _"How Bees Turn Flower Nectar Into Honey "_ 

The post briefly touches upon the organisational structure within a bee colony and how the distribution of labour is implemented within it. In pretty plain English, it has been described how forager bee goes distances around the hive, from flower to flower in order to collect nectar and thereafter, do _inversion_ all the way through handing off the nectar to house bees and finally to the cell of honeycomb.
The post also talks about nutritious values of honey, bee species, nectar, etc. 

As a bioengineers, you may question the need of studying something like organisational structure of bee colonies. But I invite you to grasp the idea that in today's economy, bio-inspirational designing has immense potential. Innovation is difficult. And in order to have sustainable development of technology, bio-inspired designing is the way to go!

# [How algae guard against too much of a good thing](https://elifesciences.org/digests/49577/how-algae-guard-against-too-much-of-a-good-thing)

In this article you'll read how Perlaza et al. designed an experiment to detect the triggering signal for protection and maintenance of chloroplast.

> Not that anyone asked, but fyi- _evi1haxor_ has already have written about experiment designing in one of his posts here).

Well, believe it or not _'Good thing'_ here refers to sunlight. Yes, excessive exposure to sunlight can be destructive to photosynthetic guys. But algalkinds have evolved to have a mechanism to keep it in check. In the article you'll read how they traced the cpUPR trigger signal relay only to discover a new protein- _Mars1_. Rest of the article then goes about emphasising on the criticality of the molecule. 

A recommended read for aspiring molecular biologists.
